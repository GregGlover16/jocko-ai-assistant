        "content": "Search in video what's your opinion on calisthenics versus weights again for me both I like them both you know with calisthenics you get that endurance strength you get some flexibility and some mobility out of it they're pretty natural movements right they're pretty natural movements are things that you're doing with your human body so they're going to be more natural weights obviously make you stronger more explosive at a certain point they also can be more injury inducing and at another point they're also less injury inducing so there's a certain point where if you have an injury in your shoulder and you normally would do handstand push-ups which means you're lifting up 230 pounds well with weight training you could lift up 40 pounds if you want to right so so there's it goes both ways where sometimes calisthenics might be the more injury inducing thing and sometimes weight training might be the more injury inducing things that's why you got to balance the two of them you know and for instance when I if I like I hurt my ankle a couple months ago and I could not put any weight on the scroll bar so I was just doing you know pistols and and school you know air squats jumps and box jumps you know I was using things that war didn't have anyway because I could do all that but the minute I put weight on my back you anything above body weight it started to hurt and so I just needed to let that thing heal and I used the calisthenics to get me there and then the same exact opposite I had my shoulder was tweaked six months ago and I was having a hard time doing handstand push-ups because it was just a wrong angle and so I was just using just using I was doing press with a lighter weight than my body weight in order to keep the blood moving in court in order to keep the in order to keep the system moving because that's what I think you got to do so I think you got to be you got to find a balance of both which means which means I'm not graded either one of them I'm not when in any weightlifting competitions and I'm not going to win in a gymnastics competition either and AH there are some guys especially now I mean there's some guys that are getting in sick shape you know you watch the guys in the CrossFit Games right now they're savages and they're doing both the calisthenics and the weightlifting and actually reading something about it the other day and it's becoming more weightlifting focused you know whether it's a long wait what is CrossFit CrossFit okay I shouldn't say it's getting that more focused but if you want to win the CrossFit Games you got to be able to lift some heavy weights you got to be able to deadlift a lot snatch a lot clean and jerk a lot and if you can deadlift a lot clean and jerk a lot and snatch a lot you're going to be able to do and at least you practice the other movements the muscle up the pull-ups you're going to be much more apt to be able to do those things than the other way around mm-hm so I mean it's for somebody that can do a bodyweight snatch is more likely to be able to do 50 pull-ups in a row then somebody that's able to do 50 pull-ups in a row and that's their focus in life is able to automatically do a bodyweight snatch I mean that's just the reality of it that's what I think right now but the bottom line is on those I use both of them I like to try and find that balance and I think I use both of them according to what my body prescribes me",

existence don't just exist go live eventually in action will cost you but your default setting should be I'm going to do something just get up move towards that challenge and go attack it go do something that's hard struggle sucks depends on how you frame it if you want freedom in your life you have to have discipline move towards that challenge whatever that challenge is and you may be successful and you may not be successful but you will be better and the next challenge you're going to be more prepared for because we're going to have wins we're going to have losses we're going to have successes we're going to have failures we're going to have good nights we're going to have bad nights we're going to have good relationships we're going to have bad relationships we're going to have good ideas and bad ideas we're going to make money we're going to lose money all these things are going to happen and if you oscillate emotionally up and down drastically it's going to be problematic Embrace those emotions but don't let those emotions embrace you keep pushing through things that suck this is a very difficult thing to do because it hurts I'm going to go forward I'm not going to quit so I'm going to go forward bring it [Music] on when you talk to people that went to Seal training that didn't make it most of the time it's some reason there's a medical reason there's a family problem there's very few people that look at you and say oh I quit cuz it sucked which is what happens to the vast majority of people the vast majority of people that don't make it through SEAL training they didn't make it through because they quit your excuses will destroy you and take everything that you ever wanted from you if you let them when your excuses make you feel a little bit better about the fact that you didn't execute on what you needed to execute on then they can make you feel better but they're not helping you they're not helping you at all this went wrong this failed didn't accomplish this and it's not the fault of my boss it's not the fault of my girlfriend it's not the fault of my parents it's not the fault of the weather it's my fault and I'm going to take ownership of it and I'm going to fix it that's what extreme ownership is because when you look around at your life and you look around at your job and your financial situation and your relationship and your physical health when you look at all those things and all the problems that you may have with those things and you say the reason I have all those problems is because of me that can hurt that can sting and a lot of times our ego rejects that and makes excuses and lies and then we don't have to change anything and then nothing changes when the excuses all go away way and people can actually confront the fact that this is all because of me it hurts but is also unbelievably empowering because the more discipline you have in your life the more freedom you will end up with so if you lack the discipline to exercise and eat healthy you will end up being a slave to disease if you lack the discipline to work hard save your money you will end up a slave to finances if you lack the discipline to manage your time correctly you will end up with no free time if you have self-discipline if you have the discipline to save your money and work hard and invest your money properly if you have the discipline to manage your time correctly and not waste a bunch of time if you have the discipline to exercise and eat healthy you will end up with freedom and you're going to start to progress in every aspect of your life and you'll see that if you have that kind of discipline right now you're going to end up with freedom if you have discipline you will attain freedom go try and accomplish something that's hard you may win you may lose you may succeed you may fail I'll tell you what you'll be better and if you don't have that kind of discipline and you don't work hard and you don't exercise and you don't apply yourself you're going to end up Shackled so if you're in the woods and you don't know where to go start walking you got to start walking cuz the perspective is not going to change you have to start moving forward but standing there lost and not doing anything is just waiting to die waiting to starve to death don't let that happen I think it's really important because as men we we don't we get conflicting messages about emotion and how to express it and what that looks like and there's a lot of men struggling right now every human faces challenges and you don't know what they've been through suppressing them isn't going to help and nor is letting them run your life because you're sad now you're going to make a bunch of bad decisions cuz you're sad no no it doesn't doesn't work like that doesn't work like that you're sad okay you get emotional sometimes okay got it now get control of your emotions and carry on with your life and sometimes you're going to get hit with those waves and that's okay oh I'm having an emotional moment right now there's something wrong with me no there's nothing wrong with you there nothing wrong with you the other extreme is oh I'm letting my emotions run my life and I'm making a bunch of bad decisions and my excuse is well you know I lost some friends or I had this traumatic experience happen to me that's why I'm doing that's just an excuse and it's a very easy excuse guess what it's time to carry on remember don't dwell I'm in control this is my life if you are in the problem you won't see the solution to the problem take a step back detach from the chaos detach from the Mayhem detach from your emotions detach from your ego and be able to assess the best way to execute that is the job of a leader if you take any trait of a human being and you take it to an extreme masculine or feminine or otherwise you take it to an extreme it's it's going to be a problem is it good to have no emotions whatsoever no that's called a sociopath is it good to let your emotions run your life and make your decisions based on your emotions no that's not good either what do we want to be as a as a human as a man want to be balanced it's it's much easier to be extreme it's it's it's much easier to say oh no emotions cool and turn them off that's easier or or a total emotion Mayhem that's easier it's harder to find balance it's harder to find balance in business it's harder find balance in life is hard to find balance but you have to be balanced because what I want is for the team to win so be balanced you're

Work and taking action And that part is work! Action! Actually doing something! That's what you have to do to achieve anything! Yeah, you got to believe it. But you better get the work done! Don't do it! So if you ever find yourself manipulating your language when you want to give up on something? If you want to say, \"It's because of this.\" \"Because of that.\" Because another reason why you're following by the wayside. Check yourself. You just might be quitting. DON'T DO IT! Overcoming your weaknesses A person's strengths are often their biggest weaknesses. And so that also means that their weaknesses can be their strengths. Me? I am weak. You know all those ways that I listed. I am weak. But I don't accept that. I don't accept that I am what I am and that, that is what I'm doomed to be. No! I don't accept that! I'm fighting. I'm always fighting. I'm struggling. And I'm scrapping. And I'm kicking and clawing at those weaknesses. To change them. Stop them! Some days I win. Some days I don't. But each and every day I get back up. Get in there In my old job when we were clearing buildings or clearing houses or moving down the street situations. Especially as a leader, you've got to pay attention as your team approaches doors inside that building. And you got to think about what is beyond that door? Is it a hallway? Is it a bedroom? Is it another section of the building that you didn't think about? Is their friendly forces behind that door? Or are there enemy behind that door? If you could think about that for a second? But eventually what you have to do? Is you have to get in there. And as I used to tell the boys, \"BUST THAT DOOR!\" And I'll tell you the same thing today, \"Don't wait forever.\" \"Don't plan forever.\" BUST THAT DOOR! And get in there. So easy to put things off So easy to put things off. So easy to say, \"You can do it tomorrow.\" Well, I want you to reprogram your brain and tell yourself that tomorrow is not a viable option! Tomorrow doesn't work! You do it today! You get it done today! That's what you do! And I move forward with my fist clenched toward the battle. Toward the struggle. And I fight with everything I've got to overcome those weaknesses. And those short falls. And those flaws. As I strive to be just a little bit better today than I was yesterday. Get back on the path! What do you do? What are you supposed to do when you fall off the path like that? What action should you take? Sit there and dwell and think about it forever? NO! You fall off the path? What you do is you get right back on the path! But you still have to fight. And that's a good attitude to have not just when you're checking in the Seal platoon. It's a good attitude to have in life. No matter what. Even if you're not going to win. You got to fight. GO GET SOME!!",

Tough situations No matter what's happening in your life. No matter what's coming down on you. Don't surrender to it. Ask yourself, \"What am I going to do about this?\" And then go make it happen! And sometimes you're barely making any progress. Sometimes you're barely making any progress at all. And that tough situation is making you want to stop. And what you eventually learn is you can't stop. When you're going through tough situations you've got to take that next step. I don't stop! TAKE ACTION! Some things are going to happen that are not in your control. You're going to get knocked around. You've got to take the same mindset! That is hang on to your paddle, get back in your boat. And get to rowing! That's when you've got to use that anger. That frustration. That fear. To push yourself harder. To push yourself to say, \"I DON'T STOP!\" And when your feelings are screaming that you've had enough. And when you think you're going to break emotionally, you've got to override that emotion with a concrete logic. And willpower. That says, \"You know what?\" \"I don't stop!\" And you won't. Life is short. SO GO LIVE IT!",

They are lies. All of them. Think about the things that you tell yourself. The lies you use to rationalize taking the easy road. Taking the easy road and leaving discipline behind. Think about them. Fight with all you've got If you... if you fight with all you've got more often than not. You won't go down at all. You'll win! But you got to make that attitude part of your everyday life.

I work out! I really don't want to hammer on a project? I hammer on the project! Don't really want to get up and get out of bed? Yeah I get up and get out of bed! The motions Don't give in to the immediate gratification that is whispering in your ear. Shut that down! Do not listen to that little voice! Instead, go through the motions! Lift the weights. Sprint the hill. Work on the project. Get out of bed! Recognize the excuses are not valid! They aren't! They're trumped-up. They're conjured up. They're fabricated. They're lies!

        "content": "What are you doing all day? What are you doing all day? Are you watching tv? Are you surfing the internet? Are you watching YouTube videos? That's my question. What are you doing before you go to sleep at night? Are you looking at Twitter? Are you looking at Instagram? Posts? Instagram videos? And what do you get out of it? You watch it for 20 minutes. Yeah, you get nothing out of it. You get a book. You read. You learn. You write something. That's what you do. I'm learning. And reading. And studying more now than I ever have in my whole life. You know what I hear? I hear the clock ticking. That's what I hear. And the end is nigh. Time waits for no man. Stop wasting a bunch of time. First thing in the morning What are you doing first thing in the morning? What are you doing? Are you waking up checking your email? Sitting around? Waiting? You know... Wasting a bunch of time? Are you getting up early enough that you could just get up, get out of bed? Go and step forward! Get after it. Biggest time drainers For me, I think the biggest time sucks are the social media. And then on top of that mainstream media is the same thing right? It's not like there's this huge difference between what the mainstream media shows and what social media? They're both emotional media. Just trying to make people emotional. Which is the worst possible thing. No one makes good decisions when they're emotional. It's really sad how much time we can waste these days with the distractions and the people trying to get that time from you. Every single second And that's why I say, \"You've got to pay attention!\" You have to watch. You have to watch every single second. Because those seconds? They turn into minutes. And minutes turn into hours. And hours turn into days. And days turn into years. And so that second... that second that just went by? That counted. And in those precious seconds you were either building or you were decaying. You were either gaining ground or you were losing ground. In that second. In every second. Every second counts! Get on track And you haven't gotten on track yet? Get on track! Get on it now! Here's the deal. No complacency. No complacency. No backing off! Fight that ticking clock with everything you've got!
